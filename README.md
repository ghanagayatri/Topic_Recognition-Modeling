# Topic_Recognition-Modeling
Used the 20 newsgroups dataset to do topic modeling using the LDA Model.
## What is Topic Recognition?

A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents 
 Topic models are a suite of algorithms that uncover the hidden thematic structure in document collections. These algorithms help us develop new ways to search, browse and summarize large archives of texts 
Topic models provide a simple way to analyze large volumes of unlabeled text. A "topic" consists of a cluster of words that frequently occur together

## Dataset:

The 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split in two subsets.The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other. Here are the groups:
1. comp.graphics
2. comp.os.ms-windows.misc
3. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
4. comp.sys.mac.hardware
5. comp.windows.x	
6. rec.autos
7. rec.motorcycles
8. rec.sport.baseball
9. rec.sport.hockey	
10. sci.crypt
11. sci.electronics
12. sci.med
13. sci.space
14. misc.forsale	
15. talk.politics.misc
16. talk.politics.guns
17. talk.politics.mideast	
18. talk.religion.misc
19. alt.atheism
20. soc.religion.christian
The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.
