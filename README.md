# Topic_Recognition-Modeling
Used the 20 newsgroups dataset to do topic modeling using the LDA Model.
## What is Topic Recognition?

A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents 
 Topic models are a suite of algorithms that uncover the hidden thematic structure in document collections. These algorithms help us develop new ways to search, browse and summarize large archives of texts 
Topic models provide a simple way to analyze large volumes of unlabeled text. A "topic" consists of a cluster of words that frequently occur together

## Dataset:

The 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split in two subsets.The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other. Here are the groups:
comp.graphics
comp.os.ms-windows.misc
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
comp.sys.mac.hardware
comp.windows.x
rec.autos
rec.motorcycles
rec.sport.baseball
rec.sport.hockey
sci.crypt
sci.electronics
sci.med
sci.space
misc.forsale
talk.politics.misc
talk.politics.guns
talk.politics.mideast
talk.religion.misc
alt.atheism
soc.religion.christian
The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

## Tools:
